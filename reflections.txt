How long did you spend working on this project?

It's hard to say exactly as I was also busy with other projects during this time, but I started this project about two weeks ago.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

It took me a while to be able to access one object's attributes from another. I still find this a bit tricky and not quite intuitive and so I hope to practice is some more.

What two additional features did you build? Why?

The first feature calculates the earnings so far by adding the prices from each sale.
The second feature retrieves the number of unique customers.

Where do you still have room to grow?

I still find it hard to have a mental model of the objects. I find the notation to access attributes from different objects at different stages to still be tricky.
